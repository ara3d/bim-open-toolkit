# Ara3D.Geometry

Core geometry, mesh, and spatial algorithms for the Ara 3D SDK.

## Overview

This library provides triangle and quad meshes, half-edge topology, signed distance fields,
voxelization, spatial acceleration structures, and mesh processing utilities. It is used
throughout the SDK for modeling, analysis, and export.

Math types (`Vector3`, `Matrix4x4`, `TriangleMesh3D`, etc.) come from shared
[`Plato.Generated`](../Plato.Generated) and [`Plato.Intrinsics`](../Plato.Intrinsics) code
imported into this project.

Part of the [Ara3D.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ara3D.SDK) meta-package.

## Key types

- `TriangleMesh3D`, `QuadMesh3D` — mesh data structures and builders
- `Topology`, `TopoFace`, `TopoHalfEdge` — half-edge mesh topology
- `AABBTree` — axis-aligned bounding box tree for spatial queries
- `MarchingCubes`, `Sdf3D`, `VoxelizedField` — implicit surfaces and voxel grids
- `PolygonTriangulator`, `DelaunayTriangulator` — 2D/3D tessellation
- `StlExporter`, `ObjExporter` — common mesh export formats
- `IsotropicRemesher`, `VertexWelder`, `MeshModifiers` — mesh processing

## Source layout

Files are grouped into semantic domains (folders are organizational only — all types stay in
the flat `Ara3D.Geometry` namespace, so folder placement is API-neutral).

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Primitives/` | Foundational standalone shapes (platonic solids, sphere, cylinder, box, frustum) |
| `ParametricGeometry/` | Curves & surfaces defined as functions; discretization to mesh |
| `MeshConstruction/` | Triangle/quad mesh builders and topology-safe modifiers |
| `MeshAlgorithms/` | Mesh-to-mesh algorithms (Delaunay, ear-clip, weld, marching cubes, remesh) |
| `Topology/` | Half-edge connectivity data structure and view objects |
| `MeshAnalysis/` | Attribute/statistics computation, PCA, linear-algebra primitives |
| `SpatialQueries/` | AABB tree, intersection, clipping, fitting |
| `ImplicitAndVolumetric/` | SDFs, voxels, and noise fields |
| `CoordinateFrames/` | Frames, bases, axes, rotations |
| `Polygons2D/` | 2D polygon generators and operations |
| `MeshGrouping/` | Face grouping, clustering, feature detection |
| `Export/` | OBJ/STL writers, colored mesh, palettes |
| `Utilities/` | Cross-cutting math and helper extensions |
